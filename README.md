# Stripe Payment Integration in Express.js

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple implementation of Stripe's payment processing using Express.js. It includes a basic web application that allows users to initiate a payment for a product (e.g., a T-shirt) through Stripe Checkout. The server is set up to handle the creation of a Stripe Checkout session and to redirect the user to Stripe's secure checkout page.

## Features
- Simple Express server setup.
- Stripe Checkout integration for secure payments.
- Product payment initiated through a web form.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js, designed for building web applications and APIs.
- **Stripe**: Online payment processing for internet businesses.

## Setup and Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
3. **Install dependencies:**
- You need Node.js and npm installed on your computer. Once Node.js is installed, you can install the dependencies by running:
  ```
  npm install
  ```
4. **Set up Stripe:**
- Replace the dummy Stripe secret key in the server code (`index.js`) with your actual Stripe secret key which you can obtain from your Stripe dashboard.

## Running the Application
1. **Start the server:**
- This will run the Express server on port 5000.
2. **Access the application:**
- Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to view the application.
- Click the 'Checkout' button to proceed with the payment through Stripe.

## Security Notes
- **DO NOT expose your Stripe secret key in your source code when deploying to production.** Use environment variables to manage your keys securely.
- Ensure you use HTTPS in production to secure data transmission.
